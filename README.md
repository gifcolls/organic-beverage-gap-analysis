# Organic Beverage Gap Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Whole Foods wants to expand its offerings of organic beverages, but needs data to identify underserved regions where consumer demand is rising but certified organic suppliers are scarce.

This will help Whole Foods prioritize partnerships or regional expansion.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / Mode)
- Google Trends
- USDA Organic Integrity Database
- GitHub

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Outcome

Highlight strategic opportunities for Whole Foods to partner with suppliers or boost inventory of organic beverages in high-demand/low-supply regions.
