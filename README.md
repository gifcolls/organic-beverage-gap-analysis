# organic-beverage-gap-analysis
A real-world SQL project using USDA and Google Trends data to uncover demand-supply mismatches in organic beverages across the U.S.

# Organic Beverage Gap Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Whole Foods wants to expand its offerings of organic beverages, but needs data to identify underserved regions where consumer demand is rising but certified organic suppliers are scarce.

This project analyzes:
- Consumer demand trends (via Google Trends)
- Supply presence (via USDA Organic Integrity Database)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Identify 2â€“3 U.S. regions with:
- At least 60% YoY increase in search interest for organic beverages
- Fewer than 5 certified organic beverage suppliers

This will help Whole Foods prioritize partnerships or regional expansion.

## Defining Organic Beverages

For this analysis, organic beverages are defined as the following products based on preliminary research and available data:

- Tea  
- Coffee  
- Kombucha  
- Juice  
- Syrup  
- Ginger

This definition aims to focus the analysis and is consistent with USDA organic beverage categories and market trends.

**Limitations:**  
There may be additional organic beverage products such as herbal infusions, plant-based milks, or organic sodas that are not included in this list. Future work may expand this scope as more data becomes available.


## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / Mode)
- Google Trends
- USDA Organic Integrity Database
- GitHub

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Outcome

Highlight strategic opportunities for Whole Foods to partner with suppliers or boost inventory of organic beverages in high-demand/low-supply regions.
